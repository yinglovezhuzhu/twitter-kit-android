**Twitter, live and lightweight in your app.**

Twitter Kit is designed to make interacting with Twitter seamless and efficient. Displaying Tweets, logging someone in, or Tweeting from your app is all made easy with Twitter Kit's components. Twitter Kit provides views for Tweets and live timelines, and a composer that makes sharing from your app simple with a few lines of code.

The Android SDK is a collection of individual feature modules, called Kits. The SDK provides the following Kits:

**TwitterCore**

Let users log in with Twitter via Single Sign-On. Make authenticated requests to the Twitter API to load Tweets, users, search results, and other Twitter content.

**TweetUi**

Embed media-forward or compact Tweet views into your views and list views to show users information that is relevant to your app. Let users share Tweets discovered via your app.

**TweetComposer**

Let users compose new Tweets as part of your app or share content discovered via your app. This Kit provides a lightweight mechanism for creating intents to interact with the installed Twitter app or a browser.

**Twitter + MoPub**

Makes it easy to monetize your app by seamlessly displaying native ads from MoPubâ€™s ad exchange in-line within your Twitter timelines. With just a few lines of code, you can automatically display engaging native ads inside Twitter timelines, implement the native ad best practices, and customize the ad display with light and dark themes that match the look and feel of your app.
